# Guess-the-Number-game-

This is a simple console-based "Guess the Number" game written in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it tracks the number of attempts made. The player can continue to play multiple rounds.

**Features**
1- Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 for each round.
2- Player Feedback: After each guess, the game will tell the player if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.
3- Attempt Tracker: The game keeps track of how many guesses it took the player to find the correct number.
4- Replay Option: After each round, the player is given the option to play again or exit the game.


**How It Works**
1- The game generates a random secret number between 1 and 100.
2- The player is prompted to guess the number.
3- If the guess is too low or too high, the game provides feedback and allows the player to guess again.
4- Once the player guesses the correct number, the game congratulates them and shows the number of attempts taken.
5- The player can then choose to play again or exit the game.
